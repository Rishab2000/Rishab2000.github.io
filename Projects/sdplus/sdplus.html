            I designed core features & UI elements for our platform - "SD+".
            I carefully balanced usability, business, and technical goals.
            The overall user experience proved easy to use by multiple users in hands-on demos conducted
            shortly after the interim releases.

            After the initial feedback session, we validated the usability of the app through
            interviews. Through the interviewees, we learned that they found the current usability & functionality
            insufficient for their needs.

            While gathering insights we focused on answering three main questions -
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What users are <strong>thinking</strong> at that time?

                <li>
                    What users are <strong>feeling</strong> at that time?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Are there any points of <strong>friction</strong> at that time?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="sh1" style="color:  #00C58A;">Research</div>
            Next plan of action was to conduct research by communicating directly with the users. For the research we
            laid down key points we wanted to determine:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li class="research_moreList">What is the goal our user wants to achieve?</li>
                <li class="research_moreList">What are their feelings towards the current process in place? Does it meet
                    their expectations?</li>
                <li class="research_moreList">What touchpoints and steps does the user take in each phase to achieve
                    their goal? How do they find
                    and interact with these necessary touchpoints?</li>

                <li class="research_moreList">What are their emotions and how do they feel as they interact with each
                    touchpoint? Why?</li>
                <li class="research_moreList">Is there any friction as they pass through different customer phases?</li>
                <li class="research_moreList">How easy is the trasnition between each phase?</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="research_moreText">
                <br>
                <br>
                However, due to time constrains we were not able to gather suffice data and decided we would do that
                after the interim release of the product. This would help us investigate problems that arise later.
