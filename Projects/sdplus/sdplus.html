            As a part of this internship, I designed core features & UI elements for our product, SD+.
            For this effort, I carefully balanced usability, business and technical goals.
            The overall user experience of the redesigned product was proved easy to use by multiple users in hands-on
            demos conducted after the interim release.

            The first thing we took up was<strong> organizing our roadmap at a high level, as user stages and calling
                them Experiences</strong>. From start to finish, we mapped five
            distinct stages our users would pass through.
            <!-- The first
            tedious yet interesting part was mapping out our customers end-to-end journey. Subsequently

            <div class="sh1" style="color:  #00C58A;">Synthesizing insights</div>
            We identified key user and business insights by focusing on answering three main questions -
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What users are <strong>thinking</strong> at that time?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What users are <strong>feeling</strong> at that time?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Are there any points of <strong>friction</strong> the users face?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            Next plan of action was to conduct research by communicating directly with the users. For this we
            laid down key points we wanted to determine:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li class="research_moreList">What is the goal our user wants to achieve?</li>
                <li class="research_moreList">What are their feelings towards the current process in place? Does it meet
                    their expectations?</li>
                <li class="research_moreList">What touchpoints and steps does the user take in each phase to achieve
                    their goal? How do they find
                    and interact with these necessary touchpoints?</li>

                <li class="research_moreList">What are their emotions and how do they feel as they interact with each
                    touchpoint? Why?</li>
                <li class="research_moreList">Is there any friction as they pass through different customer phases?</li>
                <li class="research_moreList">How easy is the transition between each phase?</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="research_moreText">
                <br>
                <br>
                However, due to time constraints, we were not able to gather sufficient data and decided to do it
                after the next release of the product. This would help us investigate problems that may arise later.

            We later organized and filtered our ideas by creating two categories, <strong>Improvements and New</strong>.

            We kept coming back to this mapping whenever we needed to take design or tech decisions, or sprint
            plannings. This almost acted as our ‚Äúteam agreement‚Äù. This helped keep the product aligned with the user
            needs.

            <em>"He is an enterprising young UI / UX designer who‚Äôs integrated seamlessly into our development team.
                He‚Äôs naturally curious about products, asks great questions and tries to understand different
                perspectives of a problem before offering a range of solutions along with his reasoning.
                <br>
                <br>
                His pragmatic approach coupled with his knack of improving his technical and functional skill set has
                been a driving factor in our product lifecycle."</em>

            <strong>Working with a goal oriented mindset rather than feature oriented.</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong> Virtual collaboration.</strong> COVID-19 lockdown facilitated the team to learn how to trust, work
            & collaborate in a virtual sphere.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong> Agile software development process.</strong> Following the agile methodology helped me in three
            main
            aspects: space
            for change & iteration, focus on the user through user stories & improve overall quality by breaking down
            tasks
            into manageable chunks.
